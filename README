Image-PBMlib version 2.00
=========================

This is a pure perl library to read and write the netpbm / pbmplus
family of file formats. It understands PBM (bitmap), PGM (graymap),
and PPM (pixmap) files. Sometimes those are, collectively, called
PNM (anymap). The multichannel PAM format is not supported.

Version 2 is a nearly complete rewrite with an all new interface.
It properly supports the maxval attribute of PGM and PPM files,
up to a full 16 bits per value.

Although I have not tested this below Perl 5.10, I expect it will
work down to 5.6 or so. That said, it has "use 5.010000;" because
that is what I have tested.
